# Teaching Microswimmers How to Navigate Complex Flows via Reinforcement Learning (CME 216 Final Project)
This repository contains the code (written in Jupyter) for my final project for CME 216 at Stanford University. The primary notebooks of interest include [main.ipynb](https://github.com/jbinagia/cme216-final-project/blob/master/main.ipynb) (where function and class definitions are given) and the three notebooks [phi_0d3_psi_0d3.ipynb](https://github.com/jbinagia/cme216-final-project/blob/master/phi_0d3_psi_0d3.ipynb), [phi_0d3_psi_1.ipynb](https://github.com/jbinagia/cme216-final-project/blob/master/phi_0d3_psi_1.ipynb), and [phi_0d3_psi_3.ipynb](https://github.com/jbinagia/cme216-final-project/blob/master/phi_0d3_psi_3.ipynb). Other notebooks, such as those found in the "Additional experiments" folder, explore different parameter regimes but are less polished.
