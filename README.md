# cme216-final-project
This repository contains the code (written in Jupyter notebooks) for my final project for CME 216 at Stanford University. The primary notebooks of interest include [main.ipynb](https://github.com/jbinagia/cme216-final-project/blob/master/main.ipynb) (where function and class definitions are given) and the three notebooks [phi_0d3_psi_0d3.ipynb](https://github.com/jbinagia/cme216-final-project/blob/master/phi_0d3_psi_0d3.ipynb), [phi_0d3_psi_1.ipynb](https://github.com/jbinagia/cme216-final-project/blob/master/phi_0d3_psi_1.ipynb), and [phi_0d3_psi_3.ipynb](https://github.com/jbinagia/cme216-final-project/blob/master/phi_0d3_psi_3.ipynb). Other notebooks, such as those found in the "Additional experiments" folder should be considered incomplete, mostly consisting of unfruitful attempts to obtain good training performance for different sets of physical parameters.
